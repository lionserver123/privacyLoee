1. Could you please provide some example of the detailed rules from your Content
Monitoring System? The compliance here is asking for more evidence or visuals on
your systems.
Transaction Limits: Transactions exceeding a certain threshold amount for different
categories of goods are flagged for review
Geographical Restrictions: Transactions originating from or destined to high-risk
countries and regions are monitored.
User Transaction Analysis: Unusual behaviors in user transactions, such as multiple,
large, or repetitive orders, are flagged for review. User Behavior Analysis: Sudden changes in user behavior, such as multiple failed login
attempts or abnormal login locations, are monitored.

2. Can you provide some examples of the alerts/ case that your system had
identified recently? Please also provide the resolution for the alerts.
Here are some recent examples of alerts identified by our system and their resolutions:
Example 1:
Alert: A transaction exceeding the regular transaction limit for apparel was flagged.
Resolution: The transaction was temporarily held, and the user was contacted for
verification. Upon verifying the legitimacy of the transaction, it was approved.
Example 2:
Alert: A user made multiple login attempts from different geographical locations within a
short time frame. Resolution: The account was temporarily locked, and the user was required to reset
their password.
Example 3:
Alert: A user made multiple purchases of the same item within a short time frame. Resolution: The transaction was temporarily held, and the user was contacted for
verification. The user was unable to provide a reasonable explanation, and the
transaction was canceled.

3. Are you using a third party software/ database? Could you share the name of the
verification tools?
We are currently not using third-party software/databases; all risk control is managed
through our self-developed system
